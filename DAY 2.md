## Introduction To Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented, and general-purpose programming language. It was created by Guido Van Rossum and first in 1991.
Python is popular because:
- It has simple and rwadable syntax.
- It requires fewer lines of code compared many other languages.
- It supports multiple programming approaches like procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
- It has a large collection of built in libraries.
### Python is used in:
- Wenb development
- Data Science
- Aritificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning
- Automation
- GAme development
- Software development

## Variable

A variable is a name used to store a value in the computer's memory. It works like a container that holds data which can be used later in a program.
In Python, we do not need to declare the variable type. Python automatically detects the type of value stored. This is called dynamic typing.

Example:
name = "Bhawandeep"
age = 20
marks = 85.5
print(name)
print(age)
print(marks)

### Output:
Bhawandeep
20
85.5

Here:
- name stores a string value
- age stores an integer value
- marks stores a float value

---

### Creating Variables

### Syntax:
variable_name = value

### Example:

x = 10
y = 5
sum = x + y
print(sum)

### Output:

15
---

### Variable Value Can Change

A variable's value can be updated during program execution.

### Example:

age = 18
print(age)
age = 20
print(age)

### Output:

18
20
---

### Multiple Variables

Python allows assigning multiple variables at once.

### Example:

a, b, c = 10, 20, 30
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

### Output:

10
20
30
---

### Rules for Naming Variables

### 1. Variable name must start with a letter or underscore.

- Correct:
student = "Ram"
_student = "Ram"

- Incorrect:
1student = "Ram"

---

### 2. Variable names cannot contain spaces.

- Correct:
student_name = "Ram"

- Incorrect:
student name = "Ram"

---

### 3. Python keywords cannot be used as variable names.

Incorrect:

if = 10

---

## Types of Variables

### 1. Local Variable

A variable created inside a function.

### Example:

def test():
    x = 10
    print(x)
test()
x is a local variable.

---

### 2. Global Variable

A variable created outside a function.

Example:
x = 50
def show():
    print(x)
show()
x can be used throughout the program.

---

### Checking Variable Type
type() function is used to check the data type.

### Example:

x = 10
print(type(x))

### Output:

<class 'int'>
---

## Numeric Data Types (int and float)

Numeric data types are used to store numbers in a program. They are mainly used for calculations and mathematical operations.
Python has two commonly used numeric data types:

### 1. int (Integer)
### 2. float (Floating Point Number)
---

### 1. Integer (int)
An integer is a whole number without a decimal point.
It can store:
- Positive numbers
- Negative numbers
- Zero

### Examples:
age = 20
marks = 95
temperature = -10

### Example Program:

a = 10
b = 5
print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a // b)

### Output:
15
5
50
2

---

### 2. Float (float)

A float is a number that contains a decimal point. It is used when we need more accurate values.

Examples:

price = 99.99
height = 5.8
percentage = 87.5

### Example:

x = 10.5
y = 2.5
print(x + y)
print(x / y)

### Output:
13.0
4.2

--

### Checking Data Type

x = 10
y = 5.5

print(type(x))
print(type(y))

Output:

<class 'int'>
<class 'float'>

---

### Type Conversion

### int to float

x = 10
print(float(x))

### Output:
10.0

### float to int
x = 5.8
print(int(x))

### Output:
5

---
### String Data Type

A string is a sequence of characters stored inside single quotes (' '), double quotes (" "), or triple quotes (''' ''').
Strings are used to store text data like names, messages, sentences, etc.

### Examples:
name = "Bhawandeep"
city = 'Ludhiana'
message = """Hello Python"""

Here:
- name stores a string
- city stores a string

message stores a multi-line string

---

## String Properties

### 1. Strings are Immutable

Strings cannot be changed after they are created.

### Example:
text = "Python"
text[0] = "J"

### Output:
Error

Because strings cannot be modified directly.

---

### String Indexing

Each character in a string has a position called an index.

### Example:
word = "Python"
print(word[0])
print(word[3])

### Output:
P
h

### Index starts from 0.

P  y  t  h  o  n
0  1  2  3  4  5


---

### String Operations

String operations are used to perform different tasks on strings.

---

### 1. Concatenation (+)
Joining two or more strings is called concatenation.

### Example:

first = "Hello"
second = "Python"
result = first + " " + second
print(result)

### Output:
Hello Python

---

### 2. Repetition (*)
Repeating a string multiple times.

### Example:
text = "Hi "
print(text * 3)

### Output:
Hi Hi Hi

---

### 3. String Length (len())

len() is used to find the number of characters.

### Example:
name = "Python"
print(len(name))

### Output:
6

---

### 4. String Slicing

Slicing is used to get a part of a string.

### Syntax:
string[start:end]

### Example:
word = "Python"
print(word[0:3])

### Output:
Pyt

---

### 5. Membership Operators
- Used to check whether a word or character exists in a string.
- in

### Example:
text = "Python"
print("P" in text)

### Output:
True
not in

### Example:
print("Java" not in text)

### Output:
True

---

### 6. String Comparison

Strings can be compared using:

- ==
- !=
- >
- <

### Example:

a = "Python"
b = "Python"
print(a == b)

### Output:
True

---

### 7. Changing Case

- Uppercase

text = "python"
print(text.upper())

### Output:
PYTHON

- Lowercase
text = "PYTHON"
print(text.lower())

### Output:
python

---

### Example Program
name = input("Enter name: ")
print("Hello " + name)
print("Length:", len(name))

### Output:
Enter name: Bhawan
Hello Bhawan
Length: 6

---

## Type Casting in Python

Type casting is the process of converting one data type into another data type. It is used when we need to change the format of a value for performing operations.

For example:
converting a string into an integer so that mathematical calculations can be performed.

---

### Why Type Casting is Needed?

The input() function in Python always takes input as a string.

### Example:
age = input("Enter age: ")
print(type(age))

### Output:
<class 'str'>

- Even if we enter a number, Python treats it as text.
- To use it as a number, we convert it using type casting.

---

### Types of Type Casting

### 1. int() Function

int() converts a value into an integer.

### Example:
x = "25"
y = int(x)
print(y)
print(type(y))

### Output:
25
<class 'int'>

---

### Example
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
print(num1 + num2)

### Input:
10
20
### Output:
30

---

### 2. float() Function

float() converts a value into a decimal number.

### Example:
x = "10.5"
y = float(x)
print(y)
print(type(y))

### Output:
10.5
<class 'float'>

---

### Example:
num = float(input("Enter number: "))
print(num)

---

### 3. str() Function
str() converts a value into a string.

### Example:
age = 20
text = str(age)
print(text)
print(type(text))

##3 Output:
20
<class 'str'>

---

## Conditional Statements 

Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program. They allow the program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is True or False.
They are used for decision-making tasks like checking age, marks, numbers, passwords, etc.

### Python uses:

1. if statement

2. if-else statement

3. if-elif-else statement

4. Nested if statement

---

### 1. if Statement

The if statement executes a block of code only when the given condition is true.

### Syntax:
if condition:
    statement

### Example:
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote")

### Output:
You can vote

---

### 2. if-else Statement

The if-else statement is used when there are two possible choices.
- If the condition is true, the if block runs; otherwise, the else block runs.

### Example:
number = 5
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("Even number")
else:
    print("Odd number")

### Output:
Odd number

---

### 3. if-elif-else Statement

- It is used when we have multiple conditions to check.
- if checks the first condition.
- elif checks another condition if the first is false.
- else runs when all conditions are false.

### Example:
marks = 75
if marks >= 90:
    print("A Grade")
elif marks >= 60:
    print("B Grade")
else:
    print("Fail")

### Output:
B Grade

---

### 4. Nested if Statement

When an if statement is written inside another if statement, it is called a nested if.
- It is used to check multiple levels of conditions.

### Example:
age = 25
if age >= 18:
    if age <= 60:
        print("Eligible")

### Output:
Eligible

---

### Example:
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("Greater")

---

## Logical Operators

Used to combine multiple conditions.

### and

- Both conditions must be true.

age = 20
if age >= 18 and age <= 60:
    print("Adult")


---

### or

- Any one condition must be true.
day = "Sunday"
if day=="Saturday" or day=="Sunday":
    print("Holiday")

---
### not

- Reverses the condition.

x = True
if not x:
    print("False")
    
---

### Example Program: Check Positive or Negative

num = int(input("Enter number: "))
if num > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif num < 0:
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Zero")
